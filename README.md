## About

This app, created using create-react-app, shoots arrows at your little man until you get tired of clicking them to make them go away. Then the arrow reaches him, and he dies (turns into a coffin).

Things going on in it:

1. a grid from semantic-ui-react, in columns
2. useState to increment a place once every second
3. state for your place in the grid, and if you're dead (if yes, show coffin continuously, and throw the arrow way off screen)
3. JPEGs of empty space, arrow, little guy, and coffin

You can see the code on Git here:

### How to Run

Remix it from Glitch or clone it from GitHub then cd into dir and 'yarn start'.

### How to Improve

You could add more columns, so the animation is more realistic looking.

You could add a second guy who throws the arrows, and maybe even throw the arrow back at him.

I dunno, use your imagination.
